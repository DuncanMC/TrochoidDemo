/**
 This class is a custom gesture recognizer that provides a one finger version of UIRotationGestureRecognizer.
 
 It's a continuous gesture recognizer that has a single property, rotation. It's intended to be attached to a UIImageView that has userInteractionsEnabled set to true.
 
 If the user presses on a view this gesture recognizer is attached to and rotates their finger around the center of the view, the gesture recognizer adjusts its rotation property based on the change in angle  of the user's "spin" gesture.
